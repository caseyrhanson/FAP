These are the instructions for using DNAscope to call all the variants in a sample compared to a reference genome.
After calling the variants with a low cut-off, the variants are filtered with `bcftools filter` for quality and read depth and then indexed.
Then the variants are merged for all of the samples into a "given" list.
Then, with this "given" list of variants, we use DNAscope again to find how these variants are called in all of the samples.

The output is a VCF file with matching variants for every sample. you may either merge the VCFs next (using the same steps as previously used) 
or keep the VCFs separated.


1) Call all DNAscope calls
		
		# usage: stil need to run these
for sample in B001A001 B001A006 B001A101 B001A201 B001A301 B001A401 B001A406 B001A501; do
	echo sbatch DNAscope_slurm_submit.sh $sample
done

		reference=file:///home/ahorning/DNAseq/Reference/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta

2) Filter every file
		Filter Step:
			bcftools filter '-eQUAL<100 || FMT/DP<10' -O z -o B001A501.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.qual100dp10.gz B001A501.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.gz

			Make Tabix files before merging
			for f in B001A*qual100dp10.gz; do tabix -p vcf $f; done


3) Merge all the filtered files into a "given" set from which to call from next
		bcftools merge -m all -o B001A_WGS_Oct2019_hg38.vcf.qual100dp10.gz B001A001.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.qual100dp10.gz  B001A201.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.qual100dp10.gz  B001A406.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.qual100dp10.gz B001A006.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.qual100dp10.gz  B001A301.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.qual100dp10.gz  B001A501.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.qual100dp10.gz B001A101.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.qual100dp10.gz  B001A401.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.qual100dp10.gz

		make sure the merged file is actually bgzipped. check with htsfile, tabix and bgzip.

4) Recall Variants on every sample based on "given" set.
				# usage: stil need to run these. 
				# make sure to adjust the code in the script so that we use the script with the given argument
				for sample in B001A001 B001A006 B001A101 B001A201 B001A301 B001A401 B001A406 B001A501; do
					echo sbatch DNAscope_slurm_submit.sh $sample
				done
	

5) Merge all the files together again.

			bcftools merge -m all -o B001A_WGS_Oct2019_hg38.vcf.qual100dp10.mergegiven.gz B001A001.mergegiven.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.gz  B001A201.mergegiven.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.gz  B001A406.mergegiven.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.gz B001A006.mergegiven.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.gz  B001A301.mergegiven.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.gz  B001A501.mergegiven.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.gz B001A101.mergegiven.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.gz B001A401.mergegiven.DNAscope.dbSNP.vcf.gz
