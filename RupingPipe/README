Messages from Katherine about how to run the scripts

steps 2 and 3 you run for each tumor sample
step 4 you run once (takes care of all samples)
step 5 you run for each tumor and normal sample
step 6 you run once
in each script change the email to be your email address
other things you need to change in each script are SAMPLE, ROOT, and SOMATIC INFO
Sample is just the name of the sample, root is the directory where all your results will be outputted

if you want to see an example of somatic info I have one here (basically a tumor normal pairing):
 /srv/gsfs0/projects/curtis/kpogrebn/TRIO/fastq/somaticInfo
also, maybe copy over the whole directory I made for you so I don't accidentally edit it :wink:
happy to do my best to answer any questions!
